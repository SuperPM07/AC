      <h1>Aspin, the Philippine dog</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Aspin is short for ASong PINoy, meaning Philippine native dog... Aspins are warm, friendly, playful and affectionate, and would be a loyal member of any family, returning their owner’s love tenfold.</h5>

      <p>Formerly considered a “lesser dog” to their pedigree counterparts, Aspins are now receiving more and more recognition within the Philippines. At present, the Philippine Army has at least 40 Aspins combat working dogs deployed in different field units nationwide. In May 2016, Roy, a seven-month-old Aspin, was awarded a certificate of recognition by the Bureau of Animal Industry for playing a major role in search and retrieval operations after a landslide. </p>
      <p>Another famous Aspin, Kabang, lost half her face after jumping in front of a motorcycle to save the lives of two girls. The hero dog received international fame and donations poured in from 45 countries to cover her treatment costs in the US. Despite the disfigurement, Kabang can still chew her food using her two remaining molars, and smell well enough to recognize her owner and handlers. She was later reunited with her owner in Zamboanga. <i>source:https://www.bark.org.ph/aspin</i></p>

      <h1>What Breed is Aspin?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Aspin dog breed is medium-sized dogs with no set breed standard, resulting in a wide range of sizes and appearances. Each Aspin is unique with varying coat colors and textures, including brown, black, white, and combinations of these.</h5>

      <p>Known for their physical leanness and agility, they are built for endurance rather than bulk. Their adaptable physique enables them to survive in both urban and rural settings. Although they may not meet traditional breeding standards, their natural appeal and tough character contribute to their natural attractiveness. <i>source: https://www.petexpress.com.ph/blogs/lifestyle/a-closer-look-at-aspin-dogs-filipinos-loving-companion</i></p>
